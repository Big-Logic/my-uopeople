This assignment will assess your skills and knowledge on implementing interfaces to define contracts and enforce common behavior across multiple classes.

**Context:** You are tasked with developing a software application for a car rental agency. The application needs to handle different types of vehicles, 
including cars, motorcycles, and trucks. To enforce a common behavior and ensure consistency among these vehicle types, you decide to utilize interfaces. 
Additionally, you want to incorporate various small modules into the question to make it engaging and interactive for the developers.

For this assignment, Compose a Java programming question that incorporates the following modules:

1. Design and implement an interface named "Vehicle" that includes methods for retrieving the vehicle's make, model, and year of manufacture.
2. Develop a class named "Car" that implements the Vehicle and "CarVehicle" interfaces. This interface includes additional methods for setting and retrieving the number of doors and the fuel type (petrol, diesel, or electric).
3. Construct a class named "Motorcycle" that also implements Vehicle and the "MotorVehicle" interfaces. This interface should have methods for setting and retrieving the number of wheels and the type of motorcycle (sport, cruiser, or off-road).
4. Generate a class named "Truck" that implements the Vehicle and "TruckVehicle" interfaces. This interface should include methods for setting and retrieving the cargo capacity (in tons) and the transmission type (manual or automatic).
5. Integrate all the classes into a main program that allows the user to create objects of different vehicle types, provide relevant information, and display the details of each vehicle.
